# Payment & Support Architecture for Patron Works Blog

This document describes the recommended architecture for integrating and managing multiple payment and supporter mechanisms in the Patron Works blog. The goal is to provide a flexible, maintainable, and user-friendly system for collecting support from your audience.

---

## 1. Goals

- **Centralize all support options** for easy management and discoverability.
- **Support multiple payment methods** (one-time, recurring, merchandise, crypto, etc.).
- **Enable easy updates** via a single data source (`site.json`).
- **Maintain a consistent user experience** across the site.
- **Follow best practices** for transparency, accessibility, and security.

---

## 2. Data-Driven Support Options

All support/payment links are managed in `src/_data/site.json` under a `support` object.  
**Example:**

```json
"support": {
  "buyMeACoffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/patronworks",
  "kofi": "https://ko-fi.com/patronworks",
  "cashapp": "https://cash.app/$YourCashtag",
  "stripe": "https://buy.stripe.com/your-link",
  "paypal": "https://paypal.me/yourusername",
  "patreon": "https://patreon.com/yourusername",
  "githubSponsors": "https://github.com/sponsors/yourusername",
  "openCollective": "https://opencollective.com/yourproject",
  "liberapay": "https://liberapay.com/yourusername",
  "crypto": {
    "bitcoin": "bc1qyouraddress",
    "ethereum": "0xyouraddress"
  },
  "merch": "https://redbubble.com/yourstore"
}
```

---

## 3. Template Integration

### 3.1. Support Page (`/support.md`)

- List all support options with clear labels and descriptions.
- Use Nunjucks to loop through `site.support` and render buttons/links dynamically.
- Group options by type: One-time, Recurring, Merchandise, Crypto.

### 3.2. Footer & Post Footers

- Display the most popular support options (e.g., Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Stripe, PayPal).
- Use the same button styles for consistency.
- Optionally, add a "More ways to support" link to `/support/`.

### 3.3. Example Nunjucks Loop

```nunjucks
{% for key, url in site.support %}
  {% if url %}
    <a href="{{ url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="support-btn">
      {{ key | supportLabel }}
    </a>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
*You can create a custom Nunjucks filter (`supportLabel`) to map keys to human-friendly button text.*

---

## 4. Adding/Updating Support Options

- **To add a new method:**  
  1. Add the link to `site.json` under `support`.
  2. Update the Nunjucks filter (if needed) for button text/icon.
  3. The new option will automatically appear wherever the loop is used.

- **To remove a method:**  
  1. Remove or comment out the entry in `site.json`.
  2. The button/link will disappear from the site.

---

## 5. Security Considerations

Following the cybersecurity best practices outlined in `cyber-security.md`:

- **Use official payment provider links only** - Never collect sensitive payment info directly
- **Store all payment URLs in environment variables** for production (if using dynamic links)
- **Validate all external links** before adding to `site.json`
- **Use HTTPS-only endpoints** for all payment providers
- **Monitor for unauthorized changes** to payment links in your repository
- **Regular security audits** of payment integrations

### 5.1. Environment Variable Integration (Optional)

For enhanced security, sensitive payment links can be stored as environment variables:

```json
"support": {
  "stripe": process.env.STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK,
  "paypal": process.env.PAYPAL_LINK
}
```

Configure these in Netlify's environment variables section.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Transparency:**  
  Explain how funds are used and offer optional supporter recognition.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Ensure all buttons/links are keyboard accessible and have descriptive labels.

- **Security:**  
  Only use official payment provider links. Never collect sensitive payment info directly.

- **Privacy:**  
  Do not store or process payment data on your own server.

- **Performance:**  
  Load payment widgets/scripts asynchronously to avoid blocking page rendering.

## Cash App Integration Options

### 1. **Cash App $Cashtag** (Easiest)
- **What it is:** A simple username-based payment method (e.g., `$YourUsername`)
- **How it works:** Users can send money directly through the Cash App using your $Cashtag
- **Integration:** Add your $Cashtag as a simple text link or button
- **Example:** `https://cash.app/$YourCashtag`

### 2. **Cash App Pay** (More Advanced)
- **What it is:** Cash App's official payment integration for businesses
- **How it works:** Embed Cash App Pay buttons on your website
- **Integration:** Requires Cash App Business account and API integration
- **Benefits:** More professional, supports invoicing

### 3. **QR Code Method**
- **What it is:** Generate a QR code that opens Cash App for payments
- **How it works:** Users scan the code with their phone to send payment
- **Integration:** Display QR code image on your support page

## Recommended Implementation

For your blog, I'd recommend starting with the **$Cashtag method** since it's:
- Simple to implement
- Familiar to Cash App users
- Requires no API integration
- Works well with your current architecture

## Adding Cash App to Your Architecture

You can easily add Cash App to your existing payment support architecture by updating your `site.json`:

```json
"support": {
  "buyMeACoffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/patronworks",
  "kofi": "https://ko-fi.com/patronworks",
  "cashapp": "https://cash.app/$YourCashtag",
  "stripe": "https://buy.stripe.com/your-link",
  "paypal": "https://paypal.me/yourusername",
  "patreon": "https://patreon.com/yourusername",
  "githubSponsors": "https://github.com/sponsors/yourusername",
  "openCollective": "https://opencollective.com/yourproject",
  "liberapay": "https://liberapay.com/yourusername",
  "crypto": {
    "bitcoin": "bc1qyouraddress",
    "ethereum": "0xyouraddress"
  },
  "merch": "https://redbubble.com/yourstore"
}
```

## Cash App Considerations

**Pros:**
- Popular among younger demographics
- Instant transfers
- No processing fees for personal payments
- Easy mobile-first experience

**Cons:**
- Primarily US-focused (limited international reach)
- Less professional than business payment processors
- No built-in recurring payment options
- Limited transaction tracking/reporting

## Security Notes

Following your cybersecurity documentation:
- Use your official $Cashtag only
- Never share your Cash App login credentials
- Monitor your Cash App account regularly for unauthorized activity
- Consider using a business Cash App account for better separation

Would you like me to update the payment support architecture documentation to include Cash App, or help you implement it in your current setup?
