# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Best Practices for Patron Works Blog                         j

This document outlines best practices and protocols to help secure your Eleventy-based blog website deployed on Netlify. Follow these recommendations to reduce attack surfaces and protect sensitive assets in a **public GitHub repository**.

---

## 1. Secret & Credential Management

- **Never store secrets in code.**
  - Use `.env` files locally for development (already configured in `.gitignore`).
  - Environment variables are properly excluded via `.gitignore` (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.).

- **Use environment variables** for production secrets:
  - **Netlify Environment Variables** → configure in Site Settings > Environment Variables
  - **GitHub Actions** → use **Secrets** under repository settings (if using GitHub Actions for additional workflows)

- **Third-party service integration secrets:**
  - Newsletter service API keys (ConvertKit/Mailchimp/Buttondown)
  - Analytics tracking codes (when implemented)
  - Donation platform webhook secrets (if using webhooks)

- **Tools to scan for exposed secrets:**
  - [`git-secrets`](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
  - [`truffleHog`](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)
  - [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/)

## 2. Dependency and Package Security

- Run audits regularly using npm (project uses npm, not yarn):
  ```bash
  npm audit fix
  npm audit --audit-level moderate
  ```
- Dependencies are locked using `package-lock.json` (already in place).
- Remove unused or outdated packages regularly.
- Monitor for security advisories on current dependencies:
  - `@11ty/eleventy`
  - `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight`
  - `markdown-it` and related plugins

- **Enable GitHub Dependabot** to get alerts on vulnerable packages (recommended in repository settings).

---

## 3. Secure Code Practices

- **Static Site Advantage**: As a static site, many server-side vulnerabilities are eliminated.
- **Content Sanitization**: 
  - Markdown content is processed by `markdown-it` (ensure latest version)
  - Be cautious with any user-generated content in newsletter forms
- **Third-party Embed Security**: 
  - Newsletter signup forms from ConvertKit/Mailchimp/Buttondown
  - Donation buttons from Buy Me a Coffee/Ko-fi
  - Ensure trusted sources and validate embed codes
- **Content Security Policy**: Already implemented in `netlify.toml` with appropriate settings for:
  - Google Fonts
  - CDN resources (jsdelivr)
  - Analytics (Google Tag Manager when added)

---

## 4. GitHub Repository Security (Public)

- **Enable 2FA** for all contributors.
- **Protect main branches** using:
  - Required PR reviews
  - Status checks (Netlify deployment checks)
  - No direct pushes to main

- **Current `.gitignore` configuration** already excludes:
  ```gitignore
  # Environment variables (already configured)
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.development.local
  .env.test.local
  .env.production.local
  
  # Build outputs
  _site/
  dist/
  
  # Dependencies
  node_modules/
  
  # Logs and runtime data
  *.log
  *.pid
  ```

- Include a `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and contribution guidelines (already in place).

---

## 5. Netlify Deployment & Hosting Security

- **HTTPS enforced**: Automatic SSL/TLS via Netlify (already configured).
- **Security headers already configured** in `netlify.toml`:
  - `X-Frame-Options: "DENY"`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: "1; mode=block"`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"`
  - `Referrer-Policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` with appropriate directives
- **Performance optimizations**: Cache headers for static assets configured.
- **Domain security**: 
  - Use custom domain with HTTPS
  - Configure DNS properly through Netlify or external registrar
- **Form handling**: Newsletter signup forms handled via Netlify Forms or external service APIs.

---

## 6. Build Process & CI/CD Security

- **Netlify Build Environment**: 
  - Node.js version locked to v18 in `netlify.toml`
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `_site`
- **Deployment triggers**: Automatic deployment on push to main branch.
- **Environment variable security**: Use Netlify's environment variables for any secrets.
- **Build logs**: Monitor Netlify build logs for any suspicious activity or failed builds.

---

## 7. Third-Party Integration Security

- **Newsletter Services** (ConvertKit/Mailchimp/Buttondown):
  - Use official embed codes only
  - Validate API endpoints
  - Use HTTPS-only endpoints
  - Store API keys in Netlify environment variables

- **Donation Platforms** (Buy Me a Coffee/Ko-fi):
  - Use official widget codes
  - Validate callback URLs
  - Monitor for unauthorized changes to payment links

- **Analytics** (when implemented):
  - Use official Google Analytics/Plausible tracking codes
  - Implement with proper privacy considerations

---

## 8. Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Netlify Monitoring**:
  - Enable deployment notifications
  - Monitor site analytics and traffic patterns
  - Set up alerts for deployment failures
- **GitHub Security**:
  - Enable GitHub Security Alerts and Secret Scanning
  - Monitor Dependabot alerts
  - Review commit history regularly
- **Content Monitoring**:
  - Regular review of published content
  - Monitor for unauthorized changes to site content

---

## 9. Static Site Specific Security Considerations

- **Client-side JavaScript**: Minimize use of client-side scripts; current setup uses minimal JS.
- **External Resource Loading**: 
  - Google Fonts loaded securely via HTTPS
  - CDN resources (KaTeX, syntax highlighting) from trusted sources
- **Asset Security**: Images and static assets served via Netlify CDN with proper caching headers.
- **Contact Forms**: If implementing contact forms, use Netlify Forms with spam protection.
